# Code structure

Logical structuring can be done in many different ways. Advocated advice expressed in this documentation are guidlines, not strict or enforced rules a developer must submit to.

## Coherent design

When composing a logical system, it is of great importance to follow a coherent pattern that is repeated through different resolutions of the system, much like a mathematical fraktal. Just as a fraktal, the coherant pattern in different resolutions can be different, though never chaotic. The sequence changes in relation to the surrounding, but a pattern persists. This is how I like to articulate a coherent system design.

## Why a coherent design is important

A coherent design eases the ability for developers in the system to navigate the logic. It is important to ease the developors navigational abilities to increase developers ability to maintain the system, to find problems in the system and solve these problems - resulting in a more stable system.

A coherent design is closely related to simplicity. A developer that is developing an operation in one part of the system will in the future need to integrate with, and work in, other parts of the system. When a developer work within different segments of the system, then a developers familiarity in each segment will reflect on the developers agile ability, the possibility to move between projects.

A coherent design eases the ability to understand the system at scale. Successful systems grows beyond intention, an indisputable fact. The result is an increasing complexity, no matter how well designed the system is. An increased complexity generates unexpected behaviours that must be analysed to solve, resulting in greater costs. A greater understanding of the system will result in less costs for analytics needed to solve problems as they occure.
