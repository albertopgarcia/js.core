[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40superhero%2Fcore.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40superhero%2Fcore)

A core module I use to bootstrap my applications. This module helps me setup a server, structure my code into a clear MVC folder structure as well as declaring routes and endpoints.

## Install

`npm install @superhero/core`

...or just set the dependency in your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "dependencies":
  {
    "@superhero/core": "*"
  }
}
```
